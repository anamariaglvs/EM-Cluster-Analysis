# EM-Cluster-Analysis
This R project utilizes the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm via mclust for model-based clustering. It fits normal distributions to scaled country data, segmenting it into inherent groups. The process reveals underlying data structures by assigning cluster classifications and calculating means.

EM algorithm: we use the normal distribution method.
#we have 4 normal distribution, to describe our data. 
#we can do the same as k means, you can use all the results if you prnt the means 
#for all different clustters

What does it mean and why it is important?

ðŸ§  Why is this important?
 1. Uncover Hidden Patterns
You reveal natural groupings of countries â€” for example, you might find economic, social, or environmental similarities that arenâ€™t obvious at first glance.

2. Better Decision-Making
Businesses or NGOs can target clusters instead of individual countries â€” e.g., marketing strategies, policy planning, or resource allocation.

 3. More Flexible than k-means
EM allows for different shapes, sizes, and overlaps of clusters, not just equal-sized ones.


 4. Scalable Insight
This method works great on scaled data, and you can generalize the process to customers, products, behaviors â€” not just countries.
