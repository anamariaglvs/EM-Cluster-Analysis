# EM-Cluster-Analysis
This R project utilizes the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm via mclust for model-based clustering. It fits normal distributions to scaled country data, segmenting it into inherent groups. The process reveals underlying data structures by assigning cluster classifications and calculating means.
